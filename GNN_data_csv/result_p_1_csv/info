info from origin dataset:
From left to right the data columns are:
1. graph number
2. Maximum cut (theoretical optimal solution)
3. <C> for initial state
4. <C> for optimized state
5. probability for maximum cut for optimized state
6. p (number of qaoa layers)
7,...,7+p.  parameters normalized by pi: \beta_1/pi,...,\beta_p/pi
7+p+1,...,7+2p.  parameters normalized by pi: \gamma_1/pi,...,\gamma_p/pi

Graphs that were fully optimized at a given p are not optimized separately at higher p, the data entries in the files for higher p are copied from the p at which the graph was fully optimized.
